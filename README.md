# Genie - Genealogy php web app

Genie is a rudimentary php web app to track ancestors. 

Though you can have multiple trees and in theory once auth is in, you could use it collaboratively, for now it is meant to be run locally. I wouldn't recommend putting this on the internet as is

## Features:
_ multiple trees
_ Multiple people can have as many relationships as possible
_ optionally display the tree using D3

## Todo:
_ Add auth
_ Buggy edit relationships
_ permissions
_ check for input

Happy tracking
